# HomeAssistantReST-ESP8266

I wrote this to poll my home assistant instance to check the state of the garage door and display it on a small OLED screen connected to an ESP8266-12E (NodeMCU).  The OLED has two colors (it's this one:  https://www.amazon.com/Diymall-Yellow-Arduino-Display-Raspberry/dp/B00O2LLT30).  When the door is closed, the state is displayed on the blue area.  When it is open, or any other state (e.g., transitioning) the state is displayed in the yellow area to make it more noticable.  

I have this assembly mounted near the garage door opener in my house (where we keep all the car keys) so I can tell if I need to open the door before heading out to the car.  Very simple idea, but I was curious enough to make this contraption, and I love it.
